# Data_Warehouse_Project_1

## Project Description
This project involves using Amazon Redshift as a data warehouse to analyze the CICIDS 2017 dataset, a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection. The project implements a star schema data model, which optimizes query performance and scalability. By running and analyzing eight complex queries, I explore Redshift-specific optimizations, such as distribution and sort keys, to understand how they impact query efficiency, performance, and data storage.

## Objectives
1. Download the CICIDS 2017 dataset and perform data preprocessing.
2. Implement the ETL process using Python for data transformation.
3. Upload the transformed data to an Amazon S3 bucket for storage.
4. Set up an Amazon Redshift cluster and use DBeaver to load data from S3 into Redshift, executing complex analytics queries.
5. Analyze the impact of distribution and sort keys on query performance in Redshift.
